# Overview

`szarkii-apps` is an application manager for organizing bash scripts. The scripts were made for very specific cases, so I don't expect anyone to use them, but they are available anyway. Rather, the goal is to manage and document scripts and use them across devices.

# Manager installation

Download manager script and place it in the directory belonging to `$PATH`. Please note that user should have appropriate privilages to access this dictionary (you can do it as a root - `sudo su`).

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rkowalik/api-scripts/szarkii-apps/szarkii-apps/apps-manager.sh > /usr/local/bin/szarkii-apps
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/szarkii-apps
```

Now the manager can be used to install or update the applications, i.e.:

```
# Install application
szarkii-apps -i szarkii-img-diff
# Updated all installed applications 
szarkii-apps -u
```

# Applications

## szarkii-detector

For Raspberry Pi. Detects the movement and records video in the parts with configured duration.
The hours within record is forced and within detection is disabled can be configured.

### Dependencies

**OpenCV** and **PiCamera**
```
pip install opencv-python
sudo apt-get install python-picamera python3-picamera
```

## szarkii-notifier

Sends Telegram message to the configured channel via configured bot.

## szarkii-csv-jobs

Helps with processing multiple files - executes commands from CSV file. Creates a CSV file and appends all files paths from the current directory. You can define bash command in the first column. You can use other columns as arguments (by its numbers).

The `szarkii-csv-jobs --create` command, exectued in `/files/music` will create `music.csv` file containing:

| command | file             |
| ------- | ---------------- |
|         | /files/file1.mp3 |
|         | /files/file2.mp3 |

You can define command freely. This CSV file:

| command                         | file             | track |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| szarkii-music-metadata -t $3 $2 | /files/file1.mp3 | 1     |
| szarkii-music-metadata -t $3 $2 | /files/file2.mp3 | 2     |

will produce and execute the following commands:

```
szarkii-music-metadata -t "1" "/files/file1.mp3"
szarkii-music-metadata -t "2" "/files/file2.mp3"
```

## szarkii-music-metadata

Sets metadata to music files. Downloads the file if URL provided.

**Dependencies**: kid3-cli, youtube-dl

## szarkii-img-diff

The script checks how similar the images are.

**Dependencies**: cv2

## szarkii-vid-diff

Checks that the video shows static content that does not change over the course of the video.
The script creates a snapshot of a frame every second. Depending on the detected differences, all snapshot will be moved to the diffrent dictionaries.

Increasing the similarity threshold and the number of frames to be checked increases the accuracy and time of script execution.

**Dependencies**: szarkii-img-diff

## szarkii-vid-convert

**Dependencies**: ffmpeg

You can use VLC to open network stream (e.g. http://192.168.0.1:11002 (Buster) or tcp/h264://192.168.0.1:11002 (BullsEye)).
